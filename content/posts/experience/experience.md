## On Campus Work

### Learning Assistant

I'm proud to serve as a Learning Assistant at [Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology(IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/), where I support students in their journey through Introduction to Application Development. Beyond simply grading assignments, I offer insightful feedback for their assignments. Additionally, I regularly host office hours, providing guidance to those struggling with the more challenging concepts of the course, specifically in JAVA.

### IT Service Desk Support Specialist

As an [IT Service Desk Support Specialist(ITSD)](https://www.it.psu.edu/support/) and a valuable member of Desk Side and Endpoints Management(DSEM) team, I troubleshoot issues and provide solutions, ensuring that faculty and staff can work seemlesly using Technology with little to no downtime. I also play a pivotal role in DSEM, where I handle the decommissioning of old Computer Hardware, and work on the deployment of cutting-edge devices for PSU employees. Whether it's resolving technical glitches or orchestrating hardware upgrades, I am committed to ensuring that our campus stays at the forefront of innovation, empowering everyone to achieve their best.

## [Briarwood Day Camp]("https://www.briarwooddaycamp.com/")

### Junior Counselor

Apart from being a full time student, on the off season for the past few years I have gone back to a place where I used to spend lots of time. I grew up going to a day camp called "Briarwood." Briarwood was my second home for the summer where I grew up learning social skills, having a sense of community, and making great friends along the way. After being a camper for many years since I was 3 years old I went back in the summer of 2021 to be a Junior Counselor for 2nd grade boys. This was a fantastic experience where I assisted a Senior Counselor in the planning of activities throughout the day also whilst having fun with the campers. Activities would range from Instructional swimming to rock climbing to just running around playing tag. This was super fun as I always enjoy being outside and this was truly a fantastic experience.

### Senior Counselor

The next summer I attended Penn State for the Summer 2022 session, but in the summer of 2023 I went back to Briarwood and became a senior counselor, also for second grade boys. This time around I had a lot more responsibilities. I was the point of contact for the entire bunk (we called the cabins bunks and the group of kids was our 'bunk'). If parents needed to get a hold of me for their child, or simply let me know that a their child will be leaving early, parents would contact me with any of their needs. If some campers were to be having a rough day I would coordinate with my supervisor to decide next steps. Overall being a senior counselor was by far one of the greatest experiences I have had to date. With the level of responsibility and the amount of fun that it comes with, being a senior counselor at a day camp will always be one of my characteristics that I can look back on and be proud of what I acheived.
