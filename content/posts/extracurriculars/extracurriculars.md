This post is dedicated to showing what I do outside of the classrom and my involvement with student organizations on campus.

## Extracurriculars

### Competitiive Cyber Security Organizaion 

In addition to my coursework at Penn State, I am the Treasurer of the [Competitive Cyber Security Organizaion (CCSO)](https://ccso/psu/edu). I create and plan the yearly budget and organize all travel within the club. I also manage the equipment and travel budget whilst reimbursing Executive Board members for their club related purchases. Apart from being Treasurer I am active in multiple club competition teams. I am the Network Firewall Administrator for our [Collegiate Cyber Defence Competition (CCDC)](https://www.nationalccdc.org/) team. I was the Linux System Administrator for our 2022 [Hivestorm](https://www.hivestorm.org/) team. CCSO has brought me amazing connections and long-lasting friendships that provided opportunities to travel and compete against other Competitive Colligate Cybersecurity Teams.

### Penn State THON™

As a proud [THON™]("https://thon.org/") OPPerations Committee member for THON™ 2023 and 2024, I've had the unique opportunity to be at the heart of one of the most energetic and impactful student-run philanthropies in the world. OPP handles everything from setup to teardown, ensuring that THON™ runs smoothly. This experience not only contributes to the success of THON™ but also puts us in a sense of community and purpose. OPP members and captains work tirelessly togeather for 46 straight hours behind the scenes, to support THON™'s mission. THON™ is a student run philanthropy dedicated to enhancing the lives of children and families impacted by childhood cancer. Our mission is to provide emotional and finacial support, spread awareness, and esnure funding for critical research, all in pursuit of a cure.

### Penn State Hillel and Chabad

Apart from everything, something that makes me stand out is that I am apart of the Jewish community at Penn State. I have been raised Jewish and strive to continue my families traditions at school through student orgs. One of the two is Penn State Hillel. Located slightly off campus, Hillel is one of the 2 Jewish synoguages thats is a student org. Friday nights I strive to attend Conservative Jewish Services that connect me with my Jewish faith. The second is Penn State Chabad. Chabad is farther off campus but is great for the high holy days. Chabad has a backyard and allows all of the Penn State Jewish community to come togeather and celebrate their Jewish faith on high holy day services, participate in seders, or just hang out on shabbat. Overall being a Jewish student at Penn State has brought me so much closer to friends I have made along the way and make new ones on my journey throughout college.
