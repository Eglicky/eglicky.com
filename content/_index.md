## About Me
Welcome! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations at Pennsylvania State University, where I'm delving into the dynamic world of digital defense and offense. Despite the rigorous demands of academia and juggling multiple jobs, I find fulfillment in the pursuit of knowledge and the thrill of mastering new skills.


## What I do

In addition to my coursework at Penn State, I am the Treasurer of the [Competitive Cyber Security Organizaion (CCSO)](https://ccso/psu/edu). I create and plan the yearly budget and organize all travel within the club. I also manage the equipment and travel budget whilst reimbursing Executive Board members for their club related purchases. Apart from being Treasurer I am active in multiple club competition teams. I am the Network Firewall Administrator for our [Collegiate Cyber Defence Competition (CCDC)](https://www.nationalccdc.org/) team. I was the Linux System Administrator for our 2022 [Hivestorm](https://www.hivestorm.org/) team. CCSO has brought me amazing connections and long-lasting friendships that provided opportunities to travel and compete against other Competitive Colligate Cybersecurity Teams.

### Learning Assistant

I'm proud to serve as a Learning Assistant at [Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology(IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/), where I support students in their journey through Introduction to Application Development.

### IT Service Desk Support Specialist

As an [IT Service Desk Support Specialist(ITSD)](https://www.it.psu.edu/support/) and a valuable member of Desk Side and Endpoints Management(DSEM) team, I troubleshoot issues and provide solutions, ensuring that faculty and staff can work seemlesly using Technology with little to no downtime. I also play a pivotal role in DSEM, where I handle the decommissioning of old Computer Hardware, and work on the deployment of cutting-edge devices for PSU employees.
