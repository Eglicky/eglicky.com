## About Me
I am currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations at Pennsylvania State University, where I am learning the dynamic world of Cybersecurity and IT. Despite the demands of being a full time student at a well known university and having multiple jobs, I find fulfillment in the pursuit of knowledge and the thrill of mastering new skills along with spending lots of time outdoors.
